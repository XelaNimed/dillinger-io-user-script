# User Script for Dillinger.io

Adds the ability to export and import documents from local storage in raw format (see `Export as` and `Import from` menus).  
When exporting documents, you can select the option to automatically delete documents after exporting.

## How to use

To export all the documents present in the local storage, click on the `Export as` menu and select the `Raw` menu item, then, in the confirmation window that appears, you can select the option to delete the documents after exporting by clicking on `Ok`. In the Save File dialog box that appears, select a location to save the export file.

To import previously saved documents, select the `Raw` item in the `Import from` menu and select the previously exported file in the dialog box that appears.

> Note: keep in mind that the script doesn't check the data for correctness and assumes that the imported files were previously exported by the script.
